Gets a recursive set of process events from a given process ID.

Requires:

**cb_framework.py:** 

Python 3 code for the low-level API interaction. This was written as a personal project, so the python wrapper that ships with CB  may be of better use.

**cb_logger**

Python 3 code that creates a logger instance that writes to file and stdout.
